### About me:

<p>I completed <b>B.Sc in EEE</b> from <b>Ahsanullah University Of Science And Technology</b>. I started learning javascript all by my own during the Covid-19 pandemic last year. I always had the passion for programming. But i was not sure about it, untill 2020 December, When I discovered myself as a passionate programmer, and become very determined about learning programming.I started with javascript, worked on Fiverr & Upwork. The Service i provided included game development and other client side app development with javascript. I also worked with Node.js to make my games multiplayer over socket.io.
Currently I am working as a full time software engineer at Onnorokom Software Ltd (an EdTech Company based in dhaka). Moreover my thirst for knowledge has led me to pursue my masters degree in Computer Science, focusing on Machine Learning and AI track.
